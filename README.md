# Fuzzy Search with Keyboard Proximity and Phonetic Algorithms

## Overview

This Python project implements fuzzy search algorithms to find approximate matches in text data. It utilizes keyboard proximity, Soundex, Metaphone, and Levenshtein distance techniques to handle variations in spelling, phonetics, and typographical errors.

## Features

- **Keyboard Proximity Search**: Calculates similarity based on how keys are positioned on a standard QWERTY keyboard.
- **Soundex**: Converts words to their Soundex code, which groups similar sounding words together.
- **Metaphone**: Converts words to their Metaphone code, a phonetic algorithm that improves upon Soundex.
- **Levenshtein Distance**: Measures the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one word into another.
